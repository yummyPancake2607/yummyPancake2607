# Hey there! 👋 I’m **Lakshit Verma**  
Also known as *yummyPancake2607* — lover of clean code, cozy CLI tools, and building stuff that makes life a little easier.

## 🧭 Who I Am

- A curious programmer on a mission to learn, build, and share.  
- I believe in “small steps, big impact” — every little tool, app, or script counts.  
- Passionate about writing readable Python code, exploring backend workflows, and forgiving bug-fixes at 2 AM.  
- When I’m not coding, I’m probably reading sci-fi, scrolling through photography, or sketching ideas for future projects.

## 🛠 What I’m Good At & Working On

| 🌱 Learning / Exploring | ✅ Comfortable With |
|---|---|
| Web frameworks & REST APIs | Python & CLI-based apps |
| Deployment basics (Heroku / VPS / Containers) | Version control & Git/GitHub workflows |
| Clean code & code organization | Problem solving & algorithmic thinking |
| Building side-projects that actually help people | Debugging weird bugs (you know the kind) |

## 🚀 Projects I’ve Built

Here are a few things I’ve made — part experiments, part passion projects, and all me:

- **todo_cli** — A lightweight, no-fluff task manager you run from your terminal.  
- **expense_tracker** — Track your spending so you don’t accidentally live off instant noodles forever.  
- **github_cli** — Wrangle GitHub via scripts, shortcuts, and automation.  
- **number_guessing_game** — Because who doesn’t like a little friendly guessing game in Python?  
- **web_expense_tracker** — Building on my CLI tracker but now in the browser, for more visual insight.

If any of those sound interesting, I’d love to show you how I built them — or even get your ideas for new features.

## 🌈 More Fun Stuff

- 🎶 I love music: anything from indie to synthwave. Good tunes make code flow better.  
- 📸 I mess around with photography & filters — sometimes I even leave my phone out of focus *on purpose*.  
- 🌍 I believe in learning from community: book recommendations, open-source, code reviews — all of it helps.
